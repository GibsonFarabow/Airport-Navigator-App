# Airport Navigator App
Prototype design of an app which gives user different time estimates of experiences at the airport to ease flight stress.

Built with two college colleagues on Adobe Xd. Would solve the real problem of people struggling to manage time at an airport and become a hub app for navigating airports - and conveniently includes your boarding passes so you don't have to use Apple Wallet or a specific airline's app.
