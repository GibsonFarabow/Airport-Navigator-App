# Airport Navigator App
Prototype design of an app in Adobe XD which gives different time estimates at the airport so you can travel stress free and won't miss a flight. 

Built with two college colleagues on Adobe Xd. Would solve the real problem of people struggling to manage time at an airport and become a hub app for navigating airports - and conveniently includes your boarding passes so you don't have to use Apple Wallet or a specific airline's app.
